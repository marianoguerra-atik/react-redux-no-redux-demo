React Redux Demo, No Redux
==========================

Simple demo to show how to have a redux like application using only ImmutableJS
and a small subset of reactjs (which could be replaced with preact, infernojs
or any other react compatible library).

A redux-like pattern inspired by `re-frame <https://github.com/Day8/re-frame>`_
is implemented in the aflux.js file, the app is implemented in app.js

The build process is implemented using a Makefile.

Note: this repo is in marianoguerra-atik because it was a demo for a talk and I
don't plan to update it.

You can see the slides from the talk `here <http://marianoguerra.github.io/presentations/stuttgartjs-meetup-react-redux-no-tools/>`_
